Let's define a field of oscillatory elements.

Connections are directional. 

The evolution function math::`E(p,t)` describes how the points in the field
evolve in time. At math::`t_0` the points are each described as complex numbers
**z** with amplitude math::`mag(z)` and instantaneous phase math::`arg(z)`.


At any subsequent time they are described as having frequency and phase as given
by math::`E(p,t) = \Int_{p' \in P} Ae^{iωt + φ + S(p',p) (arg(p') - φ)}` where
math::`S(x,y)` is the weight function of connections between two points.
