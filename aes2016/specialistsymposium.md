Talking about LITT/minimalist stuff being a bit less effective overall.

LITT treated things like cavernomata, insular lesions, PVNHs, DNET...

And there's real-time MRI-thermometry.

MRI can detect *anything*.

## 2.

Learned about higher-order memory deficits in patients with temporal resections
(salvaging, etc). Categorical naming errors etc.

"So what if they can't name an elephant?" TO very minimal laughs.

RNS has 60-70% responder rate; perhaps highest with MTLEHS.

## 4.

Young neurosurgeon doing French fellowship with really impressive overview of

## 5.

OMG white matter tracts and studies thereof. Is the next thing using
tractography to help guide resections?


## 6.

The word *topectomy*.

Talking about ECoG v SEEG.


## 7.

Hypothalamic hamartomata!

RF ablation being used.

Issues: memory, Korsakoff syndrome (!), Horner syndrome, diabetes insipidus,
potential for III ventricle edema.
