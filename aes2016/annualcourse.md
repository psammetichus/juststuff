Look for T1 signal changes, forniceal and mammillary atrophy as well in HS

How about relaxometry? Volumetry?

*Should* get 3d T1 volumetric acq with 1-1.5 mm isotropic voxels.

"Epilepsy plus" are most of these genetic syndromes in kids.

"Channelopathy era" in the 1990s; now with high-throughput sequencing and focus

2. epilepsies with complex inheritance
3. modulatory changes
