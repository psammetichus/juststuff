SUDEP is really leader in *potential years of life lost*.

Some are saying 1/150 chance.

Point made about *iatrogenic SUDEP*: ie, SUDEP in EMU (MORTEMUS study) leading
to recommendations for in-person 24-h monitoring; as well as SUDEP in clinical
trials, which one study found to be associated with a ~9 OR.

Should we insist on being ACLS-certified?
